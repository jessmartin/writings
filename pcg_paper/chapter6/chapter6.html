<h2>6  Conclusion</h2>

<p>We have shown how the general steps of rule-guided graph construction and graph expansion can generate spatial content automatically while allowing the user to have control through user-editable rulesets. Other procedural techniques could be created based on the two step process described in this paper to generate additional kinds of content. The general problem solving principle of divide and conquer is employed to simplify the creation of an algorithm for each of the steps. The first step merely needs to solve the problem of the relationship between elements. The second step can then focus on the problem of placing the elements in space in such a way that the relationships established in the first step are not broken. We hope to see other algorithms employ this separation of relationship from presentation in order to create additional procedural techniques that model different kinds of content.</p>
