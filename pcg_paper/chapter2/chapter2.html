<p>Over the last twenty years, procedural methods have been successfully employed in several problem domains and are still an active area of research. Early techniques focused on generating content found in nature. Ken Perlin describes a complete language for procedurally generating natural textures such as grass and clouds based on mathematically-generated noise [Perlin 1985]. Algorithms employing fractals have been shown suitable for generating complex and realistic terrain [Musgrave et al. 1989]. Also, Prusinkiewicz described an implementation of L-systems that is able to procedurally generate complex and realistic plants [Prusinkiewicz and Lindenmayer 1991].</p>

<p>Recently, procedural methods have been applied to generating man-made artifacts including buildings. Parish and Muller used L-systems to generate a city map and geometry and textures for buildings within a city [Parish and Muller 2001]. Focusing on city modeling, Greuter et al. describe a procedure to generate buildings based on vertical extrusion of randomly generated polygons [Greuter et al. 2003]. Wonka et al. focus on the appearance of the buildings using a "split grammar" to control the external appearance so that it conforms to architectural rules [Wonkta et al. 2003]. Muller and Wonka created a shape grammar called CGA (CG architecture) based on production rules that models a building's exterior shape and facade [Muller et al. 2006]. Merrell introduced a method for procedurally replicating models with logical variations using a technique similar to texture synthesis in three dimensions which is particularly useful in modeling architectural structures [Merrell 2007].</p>

<p>Procedural techniques have also been explored for abstract artifacts such as maps, stories and plots. Lechner et al. use an agent-based simulation to generate a city map with appropriate zoning [Lechner et al. 2003]. Reidl and Young propose a new technique for generating branching story graphs called narrative mediation [Riedl and Young 2006]. Video games such as Diablo and those like Rogue (so-called "roguelikes") have been producing randomly generated dungeons using maze-generation algorithms for over two decades [Roden 2005].</p>

<p>Though not explored here, it should be noted that languages for encoding procedural representations of textures and models have been explored in some detail over the past twenty years [Snyder and Kajiya 1992] [Berndt et al. 2005] [Cutler et al. 2002].</p>
