Make your sites feel better:

* Hover states
** Lets the user know what is clickable
** Makes the site *feel* responsive

* Establish a font size hierarchy and be consistent
** Helps user to know what is most important on the page (subconsciously)
** Consistency helps expectations

* Giant link targets
** Makes it easier for the user to get where they want to go

But wait, there's more!

* Bonus step: Active states
** Know when they have clicked
** Know they successfully clicked it (which shouldn't be a problem if you have giant link targets ;-) )
