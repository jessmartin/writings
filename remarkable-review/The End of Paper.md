# The End of Paper
<picture of my moleskin collection>
Over the last thirteen years, I've filled twenty-six Moleskines with daily notes, reflections, and scribblings. Within a few minutes of laying my hands on the reMarkable tablet, I knew I'd never buy another paper notebook. It's that good.

How was I convinced to replace a decade-old allegiance to analog in under ten minutes? Well, let's just say the reMarkable tablet is aptly named.

I'll walk you through my paper-based workflows, the various digital products I've tried to replace them with, and then my reMarkable experience.

## My love affair with paper

The first dated entry I could find from one of my notebooks is X/X/2000. The writings began as the passionate overwrought ramblings of a high schooler. During [undergrad](http://cs.trinity.edu/) and [grad school](https://cs.unc.edu/), I wrote haphazardly, not really establishing a structured habit for my usage of paper.

Beginning in 2007, I got serious. I carried a paper notebook with me everywhere. And I mean everywhere. I started my day by cracking it open, carried it to all my meetings, lunches, church, travel, everywhere. Notebook-carrying became such a fixture of my identity that when I got married in 2010 the write-everything-down habit was hilariously caricatured by a friend using a 3 foot by 4 foot cardboard notebook, acting out me writing down every word while on a date with my wife.

I wrote nearly every day. I also evolved my system continually. I moved from a single notebook for capturing everything to two: one for a daily working log and one for personal, long-form journaling. I experimented with different formatting techniques for pages. I dabbled in a variety of paper todo systems. I experimented with different notebook form factors: soft cover, hard cover, small, medium, large, lined, unlined, grid. I scribbled my way through sheafs of dead tree matter. Writing even seem to reshape my brain: my habit of thought defaulted to externalizing ideas on paper or whiteboard.

And I loved it.

I loved starting a new day with a fresh page, noting the day's date, and opening myself to the possibilities in front of me. I loved dedicating time to look back on life, sorting through emotions, churning thought-trains, and half-made plans. From brain to hand to pen, the ink flowing onto the page created a black-and-beige clarity that seemed more difficult when staring at a glowing rectangle or typing on my keyboard.

All that's to say, I was and am still deeply in love with paper. 

## A dalliance with digital
As wonderful as paper had been to me, as a digital native, I was constantly aware of the tradeoff I was making: digital has its advantages.

I got my first job as a software developer in 2003. Which means I type a lot. My keyboard is often the most expedient tool for making quick notes.

It began with simple "scratch notes", outlining how I was planning to tackle a problem or something I wanted to remember for later in the day. Eventually, I found myself needing to recall something from a previous day or share something with a colleague.

In 2011, I decided my digital note-taking needed a system of it's own. I signed up for [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/) and began accumulating notes. Over the next decade, I migrated to NVAlt and then Bear, bringing my growing collection of notes with me each time. In tandem with my paper note-taking practice, I iterated on my digital note-taking process.

Today, I have 706 notes, including this article. I've been bitten by Zettelkasten bug. If you haven't heard of that particular insect, it's mostly harmless: it causes you to lose track of time whenever you have an idea.

If you're really into organizational systems, I recorded a [livestream](livestream) where I whiteboarded my reading, writing, and note-taking systems.

My digital note repository does have advantages over my multitudinous Moleskines.

**Search.** I can instantly summon all the notes I've written in the past decade containing a search term. This is tremendously helpful when I know what I'm looking for and I want to go there right away.

Conversely, my paper notebooks are organized in a linear fashion, with each day's consecutive note following the previous one. I attempted to use indexes and break up sections by topic, but it never stuck. Currently, I just have tabs that allow me to quickly jump to a specific date.

**Organization.** In addition to search, digital notes can be organized in a variety of non-linear ways, including tags and folders. Tags and folders can be helpful, but surprisingly it hasn't proved as valuable as I expected. I sometimes use a specific tag to focus in on a set of notes and "hide" my other notes, but for some reason a hierarchical tagging system hasn't really helped me.

The paper equivalent would be if paper pages could be removed from their binding and reshuffled.

<TODO: Cut this one?>

**Sharing and collaboration.** I love the ease with which I can share a digital note with coworkers or migrate them to a collaborative document like Google Docs or Notion. Paper is still hard to share. Even with ubiquitous smartphones with cameras, wifi, and apps to quickly "scan" a document (I use the excellent [Office Lens](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-office-lens-pdf-scan/id975925059)), it's still not as easy to share paper as it is digital text.

**Digital workflow integration.** Digital text is incredibly flexible. I'm writing this article in Bear. When I'm finished, I'll move the text to my [blog](https://github.com/jessmartin/jessmartdotin-gatsby), add some frontmatter at the top, check it into source control, and the article will instantly appear as an HTML page on my website. That magical experience is made possible by a structured text format called Markdown. This is just one example of integration into a digital workflow. Text can be inserted, extracted, transformed, all via simple scripts. That's simply not possible with paper.

**Archival.** If my house were on fire, the first (non-living) thing I would grab would be my notebooks. I once lost a half-filled notebook, a series of notes I was taking while living in Ireland. It's still a little painful to think about. I never worry about losing my digital notes.

**Iteration.** Digital notes can be modified. It's just text! I frequently revisit, extend, adapt, and modify my digital notes. It's something I'm trying to get better at. But once something is laid to paper, it can't really be changed.

## Why the reMarkable has stolen my heart
I say "holy smokes" way too often.

The reMarkable tablet arrived one November day in the middle of me recording a [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDWjvhd98DI). I decided I would unbox and document my first experience on the stream. The video speaks for itself:

</iframe>

If you made it through my fifteen utterances of "holy smokes" in seventy-five seconds, you also got to see the magic moment where I realized that this remarkable little tablet was going to replace my paper notebook.

### It feels like writing on paper
As I mentioned in the video, writing on reMarkable feels extremely close to writing on paper. It's difficult to describe without experiencing it. The combination of reMarkable's marker scraping across the tablet surface produces two distinct sensations:

**Texture.** reMarkable eschews the typical "hard plastic on glass" feeling of writing on an iPad with the Apple Pencil. Instead, it feels like the fine grain of a lead pencil scraping across a lightly-textured paper. The resistance is delightful. I feel more accurate with each stroke, more connected to the surface.

**"Sinkiness."** Somehow, I feel like I'm actually pressing _into_ the surface of the tablet with the tip of the marker. There's _give_ to it.

**No (or very little) glare.** reMarkable's screen looks great in full sunlight. The surface of reMarkable is an e-paper screen, similar to the Kindle, but slightly more matte in appearance. Unlike the iPad or a computer screen, it reacts like paper. Side benefit: no blue light at night!

### It does one thing well
You can only do three things with reMarkable: write, read (and annotate) a PDF, or read (and annotate) an eBook. That's it.

There's no email. No web browser. No social features. No notifications. You can sync your writings, PDFs, and eBooks to the cloud via WiFi, if you choose. There's not even a clock.

Some reviewers complained about reMarkable's price tag given it can _only_ be used for writing and reading. They are entirely missing the point. In a world of sub-hundred dollar tablets that run every app under the sun, reMarkable's focused feature set sets it apart.

Paradoxically, I'm perfectly willing to pay more for a device that does less. Rather than getting pounded into the ground by the incessant notifications of the digital domain, reMarkable provides a serene focus on the few things that actually matter, while still giving me the advantages of digital content.

### It feels built-to-last
I took my paper notebooks everywhere. They got lugged around in a stack of books, tossed onto tables, unceremoniously buried in backpacks. They got crumbs on them while I scrawled an idea while eating lunch, and spilled on by careless children. reMarkable's metal case, fabric folio, and light weight feel up to the challenges of everyday life.

Moleskines were a delight to carry and use, a beautiful marriage of form and function. reMarkable evokes that sense of an objet d'art with clean lines, easy textures, and cool metal.

I expect to be carrying reMarkable everywhere with me for the next decade.

## What's next?
- How to integrate reMarkable notes into my workflow? 
	- reMarkable doesn't have an API in the traditional sense.
	- large ecosystem of people using reMarkable
- The software for ebook and PDF notation could be better. And I expect it will get there.
